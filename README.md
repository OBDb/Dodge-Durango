# Dodge Durango

This repository contains signal set configurations for the Dodge Durango, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Dodge Durango.

## Generations

The Dodge Durango has gone through three main generations since its introduction in 1998:

### First Generation (1998-2003)

The first generation Dodge Durango was introduced for the 1998 model year and produced until 2003. Based on the same platform as the Dodge Dakota pickup truck, it was classified as a mid-size SUV that could accommodate up to eight passengers. Built in Newark, Delaware, starting Fall 1997, this generation featured body-on-frame construction typical of truck-based SUVs of the era.

The first Durango came standard with a 5.2-liter Magnum V8 engine producing 230 horsepower and 300 lb-ft of torque, with the capability to tow up to 8,950 pounds. Engine options included a base 3.9L V6 and three optional V8 engines, with all engines paired to automatic transmissions. Trim levels included SLT, SXT, Sport, and R/T variants, with a notable high-performance Shelby SP360 model available.

### Second Generation (2004-2009)

The second generation Dodge Durango was introduced for the 2004 model year and ended production in 2009. This generation was seven inches longer, two inches wider, and three inches taller than its predecessor, maintaining three rows of seating for eight passengers while offering more leg and cargo room. Built at the Newark Assembly Plant in Delaware, it boasted best-in-class power with more cargo room than competitors.

The styling was based on the Dodge Powerbox concept, which drew inspiration from the Power Wagon and Durango R/T concepts, featuring a large, fully boxed frame with a hood and front end reminiscent of classic Dodge trucks. Mechanical improvements included a new coil-spring rear suspension for the solid rear axle and a Watt's linkage system to improve handling and reduce rear-end movement over rough surfaces.

A significant refresh occurred for the 2007 model year, addressing styling concerns and fuel economy with features like four-cylinder deactivation on the HEMI engine, E85 capability on the 4.7L V8, and improved aerodynamics. The final 2009 model year introduced a hybrid version featuring a 5.7-liter HEMI V8 with a two-mode hybrid system that improved fuel economy by 25-40% but was discontinued along with the entire Durango line due to declining SUV sales.

### Third Generation (2011-present)

After a two-year hiatus, Dodge revived the Durango for the 2011 model year with the third generation, which continues in production today. Built at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit, Michigan, this generation shares its platform, chassis parts, powertrains, and running gear with the Jeep Grand Cherokee but retains the Durango's signature third row of seating.

The third generation marked a significant shift from body-on-frame to unibody construction, making it more car-like in its handling characteristics while maintaining SUV capability. The standard engine became a 3.6-liter Pentastar V6 producing 290 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque, with an optional 5.7-liter HEMI V8 generating 360 horsepower.

Notable updates include a 2014 refresh with an eight-speed automatic transmission and revised styling, the addition of a high-performance SRT model with a 475-horsepower 6.4-liter HEMI V8 in 2018, and a 2021 refresh featuring updated exterior styling and interior improvements. The pinnacle of performance came with the 2021 SRT Hellcat variant, featuring a supercharged 6.2-liter V8 producing 710 horsepower and capable of 0-60 mph acceleration in 3.5 seconds.
